# StreetSupplyHub 🍜📦

*A streamlined supply chain solution for India’s street food ecosystem.*  
Built for the Tutedude Web Development Hackathon 1.0.

## 🚀 About the Project

StreetSupplyHub is a full-stack web application that bridges the gap between *street food vendors* and *raw material suppliers*, solving real-world challenges of inconsistent supply, lack of verified vendors, and zero visibility into stock and pricing. Our platform brings the entire food stall supply chain online — fast, affordable, and fraud-free.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Street vendors often face:
- No centralized platform for ordering supplies.
- Difficulty sourcing affordable, quality raw materials.
- No verification of suppliers — leading to fake orders or fraud.
- No visibility into delivery tracking or bulk pricing.
